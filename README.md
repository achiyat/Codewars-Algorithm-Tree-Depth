The algorithm was tested and scored: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## 📖 Introduction  
Working with deeply nested objects can be challenging, especially when analyzing their structure. This task focuses on understanding and managing nested data by adding a "depth" key to each level of the structure. It's a great way to practice recursive functions and work with nested objects in JavaScript.  

---

## 🎯 The Task  
Write a function that takes a nested object as input and modifies it by adding a `"depth"` key to each level. The depth starts at `0` for the top-level object and increments by `1` for every nested level.  

### Example Input:  
```javascript
{ a: 1, b: 2, c: { d: { e: 3 } } }
```  

### Example Output:  
```javascript
{ a: 1, b: 2, c: { d: { e: 3, depth: 2 }, depth: 1 }, depth: 0 }
```  

**🔔 Note:** if the input is not an object (excluding arrays), return `null`.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- **Recursive Depth Handling:** Handles any level of nested objects.  
- **Validation:** Ensures invalid input (non-object or non-hash) is handled gracefully.  
- **Depth Tracking:** Adds a `"depth"` key to represent each level of the structure.
